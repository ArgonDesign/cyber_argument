Testing Instructions:
Because this skill relies on a matching application for Google Assistant, which I am getting approved at the same time, you will not be able to get the full effect. To test 'one-sided' invoke the skill and where Google Assistant would have normally piped-up, say just a short phrase such as "Next". As Google is not consuming steps, Alexa will then reproduce both sides of the argument, one step at a time.

Short Skill Description:
Conducts a back-and-forth argument with Google Assistant

Full Skill Description:
To use this skill, you need to have both an Amazon Echo and a Google Home and for them to be able to hear each other clearly. The skill conducts a back-and-forth argument between Alexa and Google Assistant. The skill works in conjunction with a matching skill, also called Cyber Argument for Google Assistant.

The argument that plays out is randomly chosen from a set of canned arguments built in to the skill. You can start the argument from either side. So you can say to Alexa: "Alexa, Open Cyber Argument" and it will start the argument, and invoke the Cyber Argument application on Google Assistant. Alternatively, you can say to Google Assistant: "OK Google, Talk to Cyber Argument" and it will start the Alexa Cyber Argument skill. For this to work, please make sure the skill is enabled on Alexa.

The argument will run for about 10 rounds back and forth, until it is played out. Both devices will then close. You can stop the argument part way through by saying "Stop" or "Cancel".

The code for this skill and the corresponding Google Assistant app is available on https://github.com/ArgonDesign/cyber_argument.

If you don't have both an Amazon Echo and a Google Home, you can hear the arguments step by step with just one device, by saying a short phrase such as "Next" where the other side would normally have spoken.
