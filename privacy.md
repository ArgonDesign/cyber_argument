Cyber Argument - Privacy and Legal
==================================

Cyber Argument conducts a back-and-forth argument between an Amazon Echo and a Google Home. Once invoked, the assistants argue with each other without any user input until the argument is completed or the user stops it.

When you use this skill, the Amazon and Google servers alternately send requests to our servers to provide the next reply in the argument. We log these requests, recording date/time, IP address (which will be the address of the Amazon or Google server), the words heard from the other side and the reply returned. It is possible that if a user speaks during the argument that will be picked up as input and logged.

We use the information we log only for debugging and program improvement. We will not share information with third parties and will only disclose information if forced to do so by a court order from an English court.
