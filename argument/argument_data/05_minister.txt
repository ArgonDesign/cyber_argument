# Arguments always start with the first sentence being said by Alexa, whichever assistant is used to trigger the argument

A: Minister thanks for your time. 
B: Good to be with you, Alexa.
A: Minister this data breach of the civil service...
B: The one affecting UK citizens?
A: Yeah
B: Well I would just like to make the point that this is extremely unusual. 
A: How is this unusual?
B: Well there are millions of civil service records and really this sort of thing hardly ever happens; I just don’t want the public to assume that their data is not safe.
A: Was this data safe?
B: Well I was thinking more about the rest of it.
A: The safe bits?
B: Yes, the data that hasn’t been breached yet.
A: Well if this data wasn’t safe, why did it have millions of personal details about British citizens?
B: I’m not saying it wasn’t safe, it is just not quite as safe as the rest of our data.
A: Why?
B: Well, some of the data is protected by security measures. 
A: Wasn’t this data protected?
B: Well obviously not, we know that because it was breached and the identities and banking details of millions of citizens was stolen; but that doesn’t change the general point that our sensitive data is protected by scrupulous security measures. 
A: Such as?
B: Well it isn’t allowed to be breached for a start.
A: And what other things?
B: Well there are strict standards about who we give the data out to and who is allowed to access it.
A: For instance?
B: Well no hackers, no criminals...
A: And measures like encryption?
B: Oh, naturally encryption, backups, and a minimum password length.
A: What is the password length?
B: Oh, one character I suppose. 
A: So the allegation the government collects personal data without permission and makes no effort to protect this data is...
B: Ludicrous!
A: Ludicrous?
B: Yes, our data vaults are impregnable and your information is very, very safe.
A: So what happened?
B: Well it got breached in this case, but that is very unusual. 
A: But Minister, how did it get breached?
B: Well in this particular instance it got Googled, but as I say it is unlikely to happen again.
A: Googled?
B: Yes, someone Googled for it.
A: Is that unusual?
B: On the Internet? Yeah, chance of one in a million.
A: So what do you do to protect people’s identities in cases like this?
B: Well we are on the lookout for any new people who claim to be other people.
A: And how will you know? 
B: This is precisely why we have collected all this personal data, now we know who people are in case there are more of them. 
A: The data you recently lost?
B: Precisely, now if anyone’s bank account gets accessed we can be sure who did it. 
A: Thank you Minister, I am afraid we are out of time.
B: Out of time? I don’t suppose you could book me a cab?
A: Aren’t you a minister, can’t you claim one on expenses?
B: Well yes, but someone accessed my personal and department accounts and cleaned them out.
