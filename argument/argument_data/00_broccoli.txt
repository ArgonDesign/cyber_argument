Girl (Alexa): Can I leave the table, please?
Dad (Google): No. You've got to finish what's on your plate.
Girl: But I've eaten everything except the broccoli.
Dad: You have to finish the broccoli too.
Girl: But it tastes horrible!
Dad: It's good for you.
Girl: It tastes like it's sat on a compost heap for a month and the stalks are as thick as trunks and like eating a slug.
Dad: It is a very good source of dietary fiber, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin E, manganese, phosphorus, choline, vitamin B1, vitamin A, potassium and copper.
Girl: It will make me sick!
Dad: It is also a good source of vitamin B1, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, zinc, calcium, iron, niacin and selenium.
Girl: Can I eat just this piece?
Dad: No, you have to finish it all.
Girl: But it tastes so bitter, as well as having a revolting texture and smelling like a rubbish dump.
Dad: Don't fret, you can have Brussels sprouts tomorrow instead.
